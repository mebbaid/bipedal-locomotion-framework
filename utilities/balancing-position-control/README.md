# balancing-position-control
The **balancing-position-control** is an application that allows a humanoid robot to move the
center-of-mass (CoM) by following a given trajectory.

## üèÉ How to use the application
The fastest way to use the utility is to run the `python` application
[`blf-balancing-position-control.py`](./script/blf-balancing-position-control.py).
If you correctly installed the framework, you can run the application from any folder.

The application will:
1. Move the robot CoM following a trajectory specified by the following lists in
   [blf-balancing-position-control-options.ini](./config/robots/ergoCubGazeboV1/blf-balancing-position-control-options.ini)
   ```ini
   com_knots_delta_x   (0.0, 0.0, 0.03, 0.03, -0.03, -0.03, 0.0, 0.0)
   com_knots_delta_y   (0.0, 0.07, 0.07, -0.07, -0.07, 0.07, 0.07, 0.0)
   com_knots_delta_z   (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
   ```
   The above lists represent the coordinate written in a frame placed in the CoM position at `t=0s`
   with the `x` axis pointing forward, `z` upward.
   Given two adjacent knots described by the lists `com_knots_delta_<>`, the planner generates a
   minimum jerk trajectory that lasts `motion_duration` seconds. Once the knot is reached the planner
   will wait for `motion_timeout` seconds before starting a new minimum jerk trajectory.
2. Open a port named `/balancing_position_controller/logger/data:o` containing the CoM trajectory and ZMP
   values structured as
   [`VectorCollection`](../../src/YarpUtilities/thrifts/BipedalLocomotion/YarpUtilities/VectorsCollection.thrift)
   data. The user may collect the data via [`YarpRobotLoggerDevice`](../../devices/YarpRobotLoggerDevice).
3. Give you the possibility to close the loop with the ZMP thanks to the ZMP-CoM controller
   presented in _G. Romualdi, S. Dafarra, Y. Hu, and D. Pucci, "A Benchmarking of DCM Based
   Architectures for Position and Velocity Controlled Walking of Humanoid Robots," 2018 IEEE-RAS
   18th International Conference on Humanoid Robots (Humanoids), Beijing, China, 2018, pp. 1-9, doi:
   10.1109/HUMANOIDS.2018.8625025_. To enable the controller, set use_zmp_controller to true in
   [`blf-balancing-position-control-options.ini``](./config/robots/ergoCubGazeboV1/blf-balancing-position-control-options.ini):
   ```ini
   close_loop_with_zmp      true
   ```

## üìù Some additional information
Before running the application, please notice that:
1. The `com_knots_delta_<>` lists represent the coordinate in the CoM frame at `t=0s`this means
   that the one may also run the application when the robot is in single support. However, in that
   case, the user must be sure that the CoM trajectory is always within the support polygon and that
   the joint tracking performance is sufficiently accurate to prevent the robot from falling.
2. The application solves an inverse kinematics (IK) to generate the joint trajectory. The inverse
   kinematics considers the feet' position and orientation (pose) and the CoM position as high
   priority tasks while regularizing the chest orientation and the joint position to a given
   configuration. The desired pose of the feet, the orientation of the torso, and joint regularization
   are set equal to the initial values.
3. The application can be used to stabilize the robot even if it is in single support
   (i.e., only one foot is in contact with the ground). In this case, the user must be
   sure that the CoM trajectory is always within the support polygon and that the joint tracking
   performance is sufficiently accurate to prevent the robot from falling. Moreover, we suggest
   activating the `ZMP-CoM` controller to close the loop with the ZMP and improve the overall
   performance. In case of single support, the user must also set the `base_frame` parameter to the
   name of the foot in contact with the ground. For instance, if the left foot is in contact with
   the ground, the user must set in
   [`blf-balancing-position-control-options.ini``](./config/robots/ergoCubGazeboV1/blf-balancing-position-control-options.ini):
   ```ini
   base_frame               l_sole
   ```

If you want to run the application for a different robot remember to create a new folder in
[`./config/robots/`](./config/robots). The name of the folder should match the name of the robot.
